# Talking to the Outside World

Kinode communicates with the Kinode network using the [Kinode Networking Protocol](../networking_protocol.md).
But nodes must also be able to communicate with the outside world.
This recipe will walk through these communication methods.
Briefly, Kinode can speak both HTTP and WebSockets, and can operate as a client or a server for both.
You can find the APIs for [HTTP client](../apis/http_client.md) and [server](../apis/http_server.md), as well as for [WebSockets](../apis/websocket.md) elsewhere.
This document focuses on simple usage examples of each.
