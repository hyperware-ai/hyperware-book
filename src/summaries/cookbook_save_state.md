- Using set_state and get_state system calls
- Implementing process state persistence
- Managing state between process restarts
- Handling state serialization and deserialization
- Working with state format migrations
- Choosing between state storage options
- Performance considerations for state operations
- Implementing stateful processes

Key terms: state persistence, set_state, get_state, serialization, state management, process restarts, state migration, storage options
