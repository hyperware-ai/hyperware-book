This document provides a detailed walkthrough of implementing file transfer functionality in Kinode. Relevant for tasks involving:
- Building applications that need to transfer files between nodes
- Implementing manager-worker patterns for concurrent operations
- Using the Virtual File System (VFS) for file storage
- Creating and using WIT APIs for package interoperability
- Understanding process spawning and inter-process communication
- Implementing chunked file transfer protocols

Key terms: file transfer, VFS, worker pattern, WIT API, process spawning, concurrent operations, chunks
