# My First Kinode Application

In these tutorials, you'll setup your development environment and learn about the `kit` tools.
You'll learn about templates and also walk through writing an application from the ground up, backend and frontend.
And finally, you'll learn how to deploy applications through the Kinode app store.

For the purposes of this documentation, terminal commands are provided as-is for ease of copying except when the output of the command is also shown.
In that case, the command is prepended with a `$ ` to distinguish the command from the output.
The `$ ` should not be copied into the terminal.
