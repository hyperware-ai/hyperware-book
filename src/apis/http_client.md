# HTTP Client API

See also: [docs.rs for HTTP Client part of `process_lib`](https://docs.rs/hyperware_process_lib/latest/hyperware_process_lib/http/index.html).

**Note: Most processes will not use this API directly. Instead, they will use the [`process_lib`](../process_stdlib/overview.md) library, which papers over this API and provides a set of types and functions which are much easier to natively use. This is mostly useful for re-implementing this module in a different client or performing niche actions unsupported by the library.**

The HTTP client is used for sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses.
It is also used for connecting to a websocket endpoint as a client.
From a process, you may send an `HttpClientAction` to the `http-client:distro:sys` process.
The action must be serialized to JSON and sent in the `body` of a request.
`HttpClientAction` is an `enum` type that includes both HTTP and websocket actions.

```rust
/// Request type sent to the `http-client:distro:sys` service.
///
/// Always serialized/deserialized as JSON.
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum HttpClientAction {
    Http(OutgoingHttpRequest),
    WebSocketOpen {
        url: String,
        headers: HashMap<String, String>,
        channel_id: u32,
    },
    WebSocketPush {
        channel_id: u32,
        message_type: WsMessageType,
    },
    WebSocketClose {
        channel_id: u32,
    },
}
```

The websocket actions, `WebSocketOpen`, `WebSocketPush`, and `WebSocketClose` all require a `channel_id`.
The `channel_id` is used to identify the connection, and must be unique for each connection from a given process.
Two or more connections can have the same `channel_id` if they are from different processes.
`OutgoingHttpRequest` is used to send an HTTP request.

```rust
/// HTTP Request type that can be shared over Wasm boundary to apps.
/// This is the one you send to the `http-client:distro:sys` service.
///
/// BODY is stored in the lazy_load_blob, as bytes
///
/// TIMEOUT is stored in the message expect_response value
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct OutgoingHttpRequest {
    /// must parse to [`http::Method`]
    pub method: String,
    /// must parse to [`http::Version`]
    pub version: Option<String>,
    /// must parse to [`url::Url`]
    pub url: String,
    pub headers: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

All requests to the HTTP client will receive a response of `Result<HttpClientResponse, HttpClientError>` serialized to JSON.
The process can await or ignore this response, although the desired information will be in the `HttpClientResponse` if the request was successful.
An HTTP request will have an `HttpResponse` defined in the [`http-server`](./http_server.md) module.
A websocket request (open, push, close) will simply respond with a `HttpClientResponse::WebSocketAck`.

```rust
/// Response type received from the `http-client:distro:sys` service after
/// sending a successful [`HttpClientAction`] to it.
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum HttpClientResponse {
    Http(HttpResponse),
    WebSocketAck,
}
```

```rust
#[derive(Error, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum HttpClientError {
    // HTTP errors
    #[error("http-client: request is not valid HttpClientRequest: {req}.")]
    BadRequest { req: String },
    #[error("http-client: http method not supported: {method}.")]
    BadMethod { method: String },
    #[error("http-client: url could not be parsed: {url}.")]
    BadUrl { url: String },
    #[error("http-client: http version not supported: {version}.")]
    BadVersion { version: String },
    #[error("http-client: failed to execute request {error}.")]
    RequestFailed { error: String },

    // WebSocket errors
    #[error("http-client: failed to open connection {url}.")]
    WsOpenFailed { url: String },
    #[error("http-client: failed to send message {req}.")]
    WsPushFailed { req: String },
    #[error("http-client: failed to close connection {channel_id}.")]
    WsCloseFailed { channel_id: u32 },
}
```

The HTTP client can also receive external websocket messages over an active client connection.
These incoming websocket messages are processed and sent as `HttpClientRequest` to the process that originally opened the websocket.
The message itself is accessible with `get_blob()`.

```rust
/// Request that comes from an open WebSocket client connection in the
/// `http-client:distro:sys` service. Be prepared to receive these after
/// using a [`HttpClientAction::WebSocketOpen`] to open a connection.
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum HttpClientRequest {
    WebSocketPush {
        channel_id: u32,
        message_type: WsMessageType,
    },
    WebSocketClose {
        channel_id: u32,
    },
}
```
