# APIs Overview

The APIs documented in this section refer to Kinode runtime modules.
Specifically, they are the patterns of Requests and Responses that an app can use to interact with these modules.

**Note: App developers usually should not use these APIs directly.
Most standard use-cases are better served by using functions in the [Process Standard Library](../process_stdlib/overview.md).**
