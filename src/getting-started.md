# The Kinode Book

Kinode OS is a decentralized operating system, peer-to-peer app framework, and node network designed to simplify the development and deployment of decentralized applications.
It is also a *sovereign cloud computer*, in that Kinode can be deployed anywhere and act as a server controlled by anyone.
Ultimately, Kinode facilitates the writing and distribution of software that runs on privately-held, personal server nodes or node clusters.

You are reading the Kinode Book, which is a technical document targeted at developers.
If you want to learn about Kinode at a high-level, check out the [Kinode blog](https://kinode.org/blog).

Otherwise:
- To get your hands dirty, dive in with the [Quick Start](./quick-start.md), or the more detailed [My First Kinode Application](./build-and-deploy-an-app.md) section.
- To learn how to boot a local Kinode, see the [Installation](./install.md) section.
