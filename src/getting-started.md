# The Kinode Book

Kinode OS is a decentralized operating system, peer-to-peer app framework, and node network designed to simplify the development and deployment of decentralized applications.
It is also a *sovereign cloud computer*, in that Kinode can be deployed anywhere and act as a server controlled by anyone.
Ultimately, Kinode facilitates the writing and distribution of software that runs on privately-held, personal server nodes or node clusters.
