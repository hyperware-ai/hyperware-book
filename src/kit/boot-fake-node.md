# `kit boot-fake-node`

short: `kit f`

`kit boot-fake-node` starts a "fake" node connected to a "fake" chain (i.e. not connected to the live network), e.g.,

```
kit boot-fake-node
```

By default, `boot-fake-node` fetches a prebuilt binary and launches the node using it.
Alternatively, `boot-fake-node` can build a local Hyperdrive repo and use the resulting binary.

It also boots a fake chain with [`anvil`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) in the background (see [`kit chain`](../kit/chain.md)).
The fake chain comes preseeded with two contracts: HNS, which nodes use to index networking info of other nodes; and `app-store`, which nodes use to index published packages.

## Example Usage

You can start a network of fake nodes that can communicate with each other (but not the live network).
You'll need to start a new terminal for each fake node.
For example, to start two fake nodes, `fake.os` and `fake2.os`:

```bash
kit boot-fake-node

# In a new terminal
kit boot-fake-node -f fake2.os -p 8081 -o /tmp/hyperware-fake-node-2

# Send a message from fake2.os to fake.os
# In the terminal of fake2.os:
hi fake.os hello!

# You should see "hello!" in the first node's terminal
```

## Discussion

Fake nodes make development easier.
A fake node is not connected to the network, but otherwise behaves the same as a live node.
Fake nodes are connected to each other on your local machine through a network router that passes messages between them.
Fake nodes also clean up after themselves, so you don't have to worry about state from a previous iterations messing up the current one.
If you wish to persist the state of a fake node between boots, you can do so with `--persist`.
Thus, fake nodes are an excellent testing ground during development for fast iteration.

There are some cases where fake nodes are not appropriate.
The weakness of fake nodes is also their strength: they are not connected to the live Hyperware network.
Though this lack of connectivity makes them easy to spin up and throw away, the downside is no access to services on the network which live nodes may provide.

## Arguments

```
$ kit boot-fake-node --help
Boot a fake node for development

Usage: kit boot-fake-node [OPTIONS]

          Version of Hyperdrive binary to use (overridden by --runtime-path) [default: latest] [possible values: latest]
  -p, --port <NODE_PORT>
          The port to run the fake node on [default: 8080]
  -o, --home <HOME>
          Path to home directory for fake node [default: /tmp/hyperdrive-fake-node]
  -f, --fake-node-name <NODE_NAME>
          Name for fake node [default: fake.os]
  -c, --fakechain-port <FAKECHAIN_PORT>
          The port to run the fakechain on (or to connect to) [default: 8545]
      --rpc <RPC_ENDPOINT>
          Ethereum Optimism mainnet RPC endpoint (wss://)
      --persist
          If set, do not delete node home after exit
      --password <PASSWORD>
          Password to login [default: secret]
      --release
          If set and given --runtime-path, compile release build [default: debug build]
      --verbosity <VERBOSITY>
          Verbosity of node: higher is more verbose [default: 0]
  -h, --help
          Print help
```

### `--runtime-path`

short: `-r`

Pass to build a local Hyperdrive repo and use the resulting binary to boot a fake node, e.g.

```
kit boot-fake-node --runtime-path ~/git/hyperware
```

for a system with the Hyperdrive repo living at `~/git/hyperware`.

Overrides `--version`.

### `--version`

short: `-v`

Fetch and run a specific version of the binary; defaults to most recent version.
Overridden by `--runtime-path`.

### `--port`

short: `-p`

Run the fake node on this port; defaults to `8080`.

### `--home`

short: `-o`

Path to home directory for fake node; defaults to `/tmp/hyperware-fake-node`.

### `--fake-node-name`

short: `-f`

The name of the fake node; defaults to `fake.os`.

### `--fakechain-port`

Run the anvil chain on this port; defaults to `8545`.
Additional fake nodes must point to the same port to connect to the chain.

### `--rpc`

The Ethereum RPC endpoint to use, if desired.

### `--persist`

Persist the node home directory after exit, rather than cleaning it up.

Example usage:

``` bash
kit boot-fake-node --persist --home ./my-fake-node
```

After shutting down the node, to run it again:

```bash
kit boot-fake-node --home ./my-fake-node
```

### `--password`

The password of the fake node; defaults to "`secret`".

### `--release`

If `--runtime-path` is given, build the runtime for release; default is debug.
The tradeoffs between the release and default version are described [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html?highlight=release#building-for-release).

### `--verbosity`

Set the verbosity of the node; higher is more verbose; default is `0`, max is `3`.
