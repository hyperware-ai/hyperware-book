# The Hyperware Book

Hyperware is a decentralized operating system, peer-to-peer app framework, and node network designed to simplify the development and deployment of decentralized applications.
It is also a _sovereign cloud computer_, in that Hyperware can be deployed anywhere and act as a server controlled by anyone.
Ultimately, Hyperware facilitates the writing and distribution of software that runs on privately-held, personal server nodes or node clusters.
