# Hyperware

Hyperware is AI and Dapp development infrastructure for building at lightspeed.
Hyperware aims to provide a comprehensive suite of tools and infrastructure to simplify the creation and deployment of decentralized applications, including those leveraging AI.

At a technical level, Hyperware enables users to write, run, and distribute software from privately held personal nodes.
It consists of a Rust kernel, Wasm processes, and an onchain namespace that collectively handle the four basic primitives of Dapp development: networking, identity, data persistence, and global state.

It provides a "batteries included" builder framework that handles all the most frustrating roadblocks to crypto programming.
Now, with AI and Hyperware, everyone is a coder.

You are reading the Hyperware Book, which is a technical document targeted at developers.
