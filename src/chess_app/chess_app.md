# In-Depth Guide: Chess App

This guide will walk you through building a very simple chess app on Hyperware.
The final result will look like the template you can create using:
```
kit b chess -t chess
```
You can try it yourself by installing it on your node:
```
kit s chess
```
See [`kit` usage examples](../my_first_app/chapter_1.md) for more context.
