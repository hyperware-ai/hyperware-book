# Chess Engine

Chess is a good example for a Hyperware application walk-through because:
1. The basic game logic is already readily available.
   There are dozens of high-quality chess libraries across many languages that can be imported into a Wasm app that runs on Hyperware.
   We'll be using [pleco](https://github.com/pleco-rs/Pleco).
2. It's a multiplayer game, showing Hyperware's p2p communications and ability to serve frontends
3. It's fun!

In `my-chess/Cargo.toml`, which should be in the `my-chess/` process directory inside the `my-chess/` package directory, add `pleco = "0.5"` to your dependencies.
In your `my-chess/src/lib.rs`, replace the existing code with:

```rust
use pleco::Board;
use hyperware_process_lib::{await_message, call_init, println, Address};

wit_bindgen::generate!({
    path: "../target/wit",
    world: "process-v1",
});

call_init!(init);
fn init(our: Address) {
    println!("started");

    let my-chess_board = Board::start_pos().fen();

    println!("my-chess_board: {my-chess_board}");

    loop {
        // Call await_message() to receive any incoming messages.
        await_message().map(|message| {
            if !message.is_request() { continue };
            println!(
                "{our}: got request from {}: {}",
                message.source(),
                String::from_utf8_lossy(message.body())
            );
        });
    }
}
```

Now, you have access to a chess board and can manipulate it easily.

The [pleco docs](https://github.com/pleco-rs/Pleco#using-pleco-as-a-library) show everything you can do using the pleco library.
But this isn't very interesting by itself!
Chess is a multiplayer game.
To make your app multiplayer, start by creating a persisted state for the chess app and a `body` format for sending messages to other nodes.

The first step to creating a multiplayer or otherwise networked project is adjusting your `manifest.json` to specify what [capabilities](../system/process/capabilities.md) your process will grant.

Go to `my-chess/manifest.json` and make sure your chess process is public and gets network access:
```json
[
    {
        "process_name": "my-chess",
        "process_wasm_path": "/my-chess.wasm",
        "on_exit": "Restart",
        "request_networking": true,
        "request_capabilities": [],
        "grant_capabilities": [],
        "public": true
    }
]
```

Now, in `my-chess/src/lib.rs` add the following simple Request/Response interface and persistable game state:
```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
enum ChessRequest {
    NewGame { white: String, black: String },
    Move { game_id: String, move_str: String },
    Resign(String),
}

#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
enum ChessResponse {
    NewGameAccepted,
    NewGameRejected,
    MoveAccepted,
    MoveRejected,
}

///
/// Our serializable state format.
///
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct ChessState {
    pub games: HashMap<String, Game>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Game {
    /// the node with whom we are playing
    pub id: String,
    pub turns: u64,
    /// a string representation of the board using FEN
    pub board: String,
    /// the white player's node id
    pub white: String,
    /// the black player's node id
    pub black: String,
    pub ended: bool,
}
```

Creating explicit `ChessRequest` and `ChessResponse` types is the easiest way to reliably communicate between two processes.
It makes message-passing very simple.
If you get a request, you can deserialize it to `ChessRequest` and ignore or throw an error if that fails.
If you get a response, you can do the same but with `ChessResponse`.
And every request and response that you send can be serialized in kind.
More advanced apps can take on different structures, but a top-level `enum` to serialize/deserialize and match on is usually a good idea.

The `ChessState` `struct` shown above can also be persisted using the `set_state` and `get_state` commands exposed by Hyperdrive.
Note that the `Game` `struct` here has `board` as a `String`.
This is because the `Board` type from pleco doesn't implement `Serialize` or `Deserialize`.
We'll have to convert it to a string using `fen()` before persisting it.
Then, you will convert it back to a `Board` with `Board::from_fen()` when you load it from state.

The code below will contain a version of the `init()` function that creates an event loop and handles ChessRequests.
First, however, it's important to note that these types already bake in some assumptions about our "chess protocol".
Remember, requests can either expect a response, or be fired and forgotten.
Unless a response is expected, there's no way to know if a request was received or not.
In a game like chess, most actions have a logical response.
Otherwise, there's no way to easily alert the user that their counterparty has gone offline, or started to otherwise ignore our moves.
For the sake of the tutorial, there are three kinds of requests and only two expect a response.
In our code, the `NewGame` and `Move` requests will always await a response, blocking until they receive one (or the request times out).
`Resign`, however, will be fire-and-forget.
While a "real" game may prefer to wait for a response, it is important to let one player resign and thus clear their state *without* that resignation being "accepted" by a non-responsive player, so production-grade resignation logic is non-trivial.

> An aside: when building consumer-grade peer-to-peer apps, you'll find that there are in fact very few "trivial" interaction patterns.
> Something as simple as resigning from a one-on-one game, which would be a single POST request in a client-frontend <> server-backend architecture, requires well-thought-out negotiations to ensure that both players can walk away with a clean state machine, regardless of whether the counterparty is cooperating.
> Adding more "players" to the mix makes this even more complex.
> To keep things clean, leverage the request/response pattern and the `context` field to store information about how to handle a given response, if you're not awaiting it in a blocking fashion.

Below, you'll find the full code for the CLI version of the app.
You can build it and install it on a node using `kit`.
You can interact with it in the terminal, primitively, like so (assuming your first node is `fake.os` and second is `fake2.os`):
```
m our@my-chess:my-chess:template.os '{"NewGame": {"white": "fake.os", "black": "fake2.os"}}'
m our@my-chess:my-chess:template.os '{"Move": {"game_id": "fake2.os", "move_str": "e2e4"}}'
```
(If you want to make a more ergonomic CLI app, consider parsing `body` as a string, or better yet, writing [terminal scripts](../cookbook/writing_scripts.md) for various game actions.)

As you read through the code, you might notice a problem with this app: there's no way to see your games!
A fun project would be to add a CLI command that shows you, in-terminal, the board for a given `game_id`.
But in the [next chapter](./frontend.md), we'll add a frontend to this app so you can see your games in a browser.
