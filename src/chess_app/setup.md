# Environment Setup

To prepare for this tutorial, follow the environment setup guide [here](../my_first_app/chapter_1.md), i.e. [start a fake node](../my_first_app/chapter_1.md#booting-a-fake-kinode-node) and then, in another terminal, run:
```
kit new my_chess
cd my_chess
kit build
kit start-package
```

Once you have the template app installed and can see it running on your testing node, continue to the next chapter...
