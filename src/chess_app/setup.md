# Environment Setup

To prepare for this tutorial, follow the environment setup guide [here](../my_first_app/chapter_1.md), i.e. [start a fake node](../my_first_app/chapter_1.md#booting-a-fake-hyperware-node) and then, in another terminal, run:
```
kit new my-chess --template blank
cd my-chess
kit b
kit start-package
```

Once you have the template app installed and can see it running on your testing node, continue to the next chapter...
